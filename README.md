# Machine Learning-Based DDoS Attack Detection Framework

## Overview
This project implements and evaluates various machine learning algorithms for detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in network traffic. The framework analyzes network behavior patterns using the CICIDS2017 dataset and employs eight different classification algorithms to identify potential DDoS attacks with high accuracy.

## Key Features
- Implementation of 8 different machine learning models:
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  - Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes

- Comprehensive performance evaluation using multiple metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - ROC Curves
  - Processing Time

- Novel time-weighted performance metric for real-world applicability assessment
- Feature engineering and selection of 24 critical network parameters
- Integration capabilities with existing IDS/IPS systems
